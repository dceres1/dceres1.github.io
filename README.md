# Work Experience
### Internship at [Paltech GmbH](https://www.linkedin.com/company/paltech-gmbh/) 

Developed a custom ROS 2 wrapper based on the Python CANopen library, enabling control of multiple motors via the CANopen communication protocol. The package simplified motor management and ensured compatibility with ROS 2 systems, enhancing functionality for robotics applications.

### Hardware Engineer at [Soluciones en Electr√≥nica Especializada y de Potencia S.A. de C.V.](https://www.selespo.com.mx/)

*Development and manufacture of an educational robot.*
- Achieved a human-robot interaction with the following functionalities: speech recognition (speech-to-text), chatbot, speech synthesis (text-to-speech) and remote manipulation of the robot using Robotic Operating System (ROS), C++ and Python.

*Design and fabrication of a myoelectric low-cost arm prosthesis.*
- Designed the CAD model of a prosthetic socket that improves the fit to the user's residual limb.
- Wrote software that allows readings from both an electromyography (EMG) sensor and an infrared sensor to control the prosthesis.
- Designed two-layer circuit board for the prosthesis.

*Design and assembly of a large format 3D printer.*
- Designed the mechanical system of a large format 3D printer, with a printing area of 90cm x 90cm x 120cm and more than 200 components.


*Modeling and prototyping of mechanical parts and electrical enclosures.*
- Designed enclosures and custom mechanic parts for medical devices as vital signs monitors, mechanical ventilators and magnetotherapy machines using sheet metal design and 3D printing technologies.

### Undergraduate researcher at [BUAP, Faculty of Physical Mathematical Sciences](https://www.fcfm.buap.mx/)

- Wrote software in MATLAB/C++ to test optimization algorithms based on Lyapunov theory for analog circuit design process
