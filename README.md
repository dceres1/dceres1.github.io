# Robotics Engineer
Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio.

I am an Erasmus Mundus Scholar and Master's student in Intelligent Field Robotic Systems (IFRoS). This joint master’s program, taught at Universitat de Girona, Spain, and the University of Zagreb, Croatia, focuses on the technologies behind intelligent mobile robots. I am passionate about localization algorithms, applying machine learning to robotic perception, and developing planning algorithms for autonomous systems. My goal is to contribute to the future of autonomous robots in real-world applications.

# Work Experience
### Internship at [Paltech GmbH](https://www.linkedin.com/company/paltech-gmbh/) 

Developed a custom ROS 2 wrapper based on the Python CANopen library, enabling control of multiple motors via the CANopen communication protocol. The package simplified motor management and ensured compatibility with ROS 2 systems, enhancing functionality for robotics applications.

### Hardware Engineer at [Soluciones en Electrónica Especializada y de Potencia S.A. de C.V.](https://www.selespo.com.mx/)

*Development and manufacture of an educational robot.*
- Achieved a human-robot interaction with the following functionalities: speech recognition (speech-to-text), chatbot, speech synthesis (text-to-speech) and remote manipulation of the robot using Robotic Operating System (ROS), C++ and Python.

*Design and fabrication of a myoelectric low-cost arm prosthesis.*
- Designed the CAD model of a prosthetic socket that improves the fit to the user's residual limb.
- Wrote software that allows readings from both an electromyography (EMG) sensor and an infrared sensor to control the prosthesis.
- Designed two-layer circuit board for the prosthesis.

*Design and assembly of a large format 3D printer.*
- Designed the mechanical system of a large format 3D printer, with a printing area of 90cm x 90cm x 120cm and more than 200 components.


*Modeling and prototyping of mechanical parts and electrical enclosures.*
- Designed enclosures and custom mechanic parts for medical devices as vital signs monitors, mechanical ventilators and magnetotherapy machines using sheet metal design and 3D printing technologies.

### Undergraduate researcher at [BUAP, Faculty of Physical Mathematical Sciences](https://www.fcfm.buap.mx/)

- Wrote software in MATLAB/C++ to test optimization algorithms based on Lyapunov theory for analog circuit design process


# Projects

### Stereo Visual Odometry on the Kitti Dataset
Developed a Stereo Visual Odometry system leveraging a 3D-2D pose estimation pipeline to estimate vehicle motion from the KITTI dataset. The project involved keypoint tracking, disparity calculation, triangulation of 3D points, and pose estimation to achieve accurate trajectory reconstruction.

### Reynold-Rules applied to Multi-robot Systems
Implemented algorithms based on Reynolds' flocking rules (cohesion, separation, and alignment) to control robots in simulation. The project involved developing and testing these algorithms in the Stage 2D simulator within the ROS framework, demonstrating swarm behaviors and exploring extensions to the basic rules for enhanced functionality.

### Multi-Object Tracking using Kalman Filter on Event-Based Data
Object tracking has become an important area of study due to the increment of autonomous systems equipped with cameras to perceive and interpret their surrounding environment. However, not many tracking algorithms have been developed for event-based cameras. This report aims to modify the existing Multiple Object Tracker Deep SORT to track corner events gathered by an Event Based Camera.

### Turtlebot Frontier-based Exploration
Many scenarios in which robots are used nowadays require some degree of autonomous exploration. We design and implement an exploration strategy that maximizes the information gain by navigating towards frontiers (the edge between known and unknown space) using a sampling-based path planner (RRT*) with kinematic constraints. The environment is mapped using a front-facing depth sensor. We test our approach on a Turtlebot robot with dead-reckoning localization, and compare simulation results with real-world indoor experiments.

### TurtleBot Graph SLAM using ArUco features
Solution of a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping problem using a factor graph to optimize the belief about the robot pose and the location of observed features. The graph is extended when enough displacement has occurred, or a new feature is observed. In particular, we use ArUco markers as static, easy-to-identify features, and integrate odometry with IMU readings using an Extended Kalman Filter. The method is implemented in ROS and tested on a differential-drive TurtleBot, in the Stonefish simulator and in real life.

### Mobile Manipulation Using a TurtleBot And a 4DOF Arm
Implementation of a pick, transport and place task for a TurtleBot differential drive robot equipped with a SwiftPro Arm. A rectangular object, identified and localized using an ArUco marker, is collected from the environment and transported to a predefined location. Manipulator velocity control is achieved using the Task Priority algorithm. The implementation is tested in the Stonefish simulator and on a real robot.
